 CQRS, Unit of Work, Specification Pattern, Repository & Clean Architecture

 Why Use These Patterns?

  CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Separates read and write operations for better scalability and maintainability.
- Enhances system performance by optimizing queries separately from commands.
- Enables better security by restricting command operations to specific users.

   Unit of Work
- Ensures data integrity by managing database transactions.
- Reduces database round trips by batching multiple operations into a single transaction.
- Simplifies repository interactions by centralizing data access logic.

   Specification Pattern
- Encapsulates query logic into reusable and composable specifications.
- Enhances flexibility by allowing dynamic filtering without modifying repository methods.
- Improves maintainability by separating concerns between business logic and data access.

  Repository Pattern
- Abstracts database operations for better maintainability.
- Provides a clean API for accessing data.
- Reduces code duplication by centralizing common data operations.

   Clean Architecture
- Separates concerns into distinct layers, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
- Encourages testability by isolating business logic from infrastructure concerns.
- Supports maintainability by enforcing clear boundaries between application components.


   Benefits of This Approach
âœ… Improved scalability and performance.
âœ… Clean, maintainable, and testable code.
âœ… Better separation of concerns for easier debugging and extension.
âœ… Reusable and modular design patterns for enterprise applications.

  Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core** - For building the API.
- **Entity Framework Core** - For database operations.
- **MediatR** - For implementing CQRS.

- **SQL Server** - As the database provider.

  How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the database connection in `appsettings.json`.
3. Run database migrations using Entity Framework Core.
4. Start the application and test CQRS-based endpoints.

 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
 
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git](https://github.com/mohamedkamal-17/CQRSAndSpecificationWithRepository.git
 
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd CQRSAndSpecificationWithRepository
   
3. Update the database:
   
   dotnet ef database update
   or 
   
  Update-Database 
from
  Visual Studio Package Manager Console  
   
5. Run the application:
   
   dotnet run
   

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to structure an ASP.NET Core application using CQRS, Unit of Work, Specification Pattern, and Repository Pattern. These patterns make the codebase more scalable, testable, and maintainable.
